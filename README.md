## fillit
Fillit is a [42-network](https://www.codam.nl/en/the-42-network) project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. The purpose of this project is to take a file containing a list of tetriminos to sort them in the smallest square possible.
The program takes a file containing a list of Tetriminos as parameter and prints the square with tetriminos to the standard output.

## Compiling
Run ```make```, an executable called ```fillit``` should compile directly. Please submit an issue if you run into any.

## Tetriminos
A Tetrimino is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris. The map ```tetriminos``` contains three example files with Tetriminos.

## How to use?
After creating the executable file, ```fillit``` can be executed by giving it a Tetrimino-file as parameter e.g.:

```./fillit tetriminos/list1```
